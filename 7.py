# Write python code for finding an approximate Solution for the following differential equation by Galerkin's Method : 

# d/dx((1+x)*du/dx) = -x^2 

# u(0) = u(1) = 0 ; 0 < x< 1

# Use the following polynomial basis : 
# p1=x*(1-x)
# p2=x*(1/2-x)*(1-x)
# p3=x*(1/3-x)*(2/3-x)*(1-x)
# p4=x*(1/4-x)*(1/2-x)*(3/4-x)*(1-x)

# Calculate error separately and plot graphs on a single plot of exact solution , approximate solution and error. Also do this for each value of number of basis polynomials from 1 to 4
